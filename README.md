# About Me
As long as I can remember, I've always been on a computer. Although Computer Science has always been somewhat interesting to me, the first time I really messed with a program in a tangible way was messing with my HUD on the videogame Team Fortress 2. It was just moving around files and editing config files, but it was the first time I realized I could just interact directly with my computer and the programs it had on it.

One of my biggest dissapointments with college was honestly that I'm not going to be able to take more courses for this degree. There is a wealth of interesting topics in CS, whether it be Computer Graphics, Data Science, Cyber Security, or any other number of topics, I feel like there's always something new to see and make. That's why I co-founded SIG Hackathons at UIC's local ACM chapter. I think the most important skill you can develop as a CS major is the ability to teach yourself, which is exactly what I intend to do.

Additionally, I am primarily interested in the FOSS movement and Cyber Security, which is why I am an active member of UIC's Linux Users Group chapter. My goal is to study as much as I can about encryption, networking, and computer security as a whole, then share as much information as I can with my peers and the world.
